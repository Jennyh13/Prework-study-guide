# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this coding bootcamp is to learn and grow in a field so many people are doing. I have a son and he keeps me going to do better. I did this project to learn and see what this bootcamp has for me. This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I learn HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
